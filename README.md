# Ubuntu

I've recently switched to using Ubuntu for web development.

This project will setup Ubuntu 18.04 with some essential apps for me to use.

A seperate script will set it up for web development.

## Installation

sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://github.com/ptibbetts/Ubuntu/raw/master/install.sh)"
```
